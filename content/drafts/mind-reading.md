What if I told you that we are surrounded by psychic beings?

It's true!

Psychics live among us, and they can **read your mind**.

<!--more-->


## Wait... what are you talking about!?
Well... politicians, journalists, actors, actresses, and even your own relatives.

They can **read your mind**.

How do I know? They _love_ to say so.

You have probably had the pleasure of reading the news or scrolling through your Facebook 
or Twitter feed and seeing these magicians in action.

If you haven't, you should keep reading!

### Example 1 - The news reporting real inner thoughts in real-time

{{< tweet 1244705980845297666 >}}

Wow, I had no idea that Chris knew the President's inner thoughts.
Now that's a superpower!

Why aren't we utilizing him more?
We need a lot more insight on what the President really believes.

Notice that he prefaces his fabrication with _"In Trump's mind..."_

{{< tweet 1220064298925461505 >}}

Incredible! Joe heard two Republican Senators have a discussion in his mind
and decided to tell the world about it.

He knows _exactly_ what Republican Senators think!

### Example 2 - Delusional man pities the delusional other side

{{< tweet 1310596683613515783 >}}

One of the problems with Twitter and with social media in general is that
the algorithms push people into ideological camps and as a result, echochambers organically
form to shield individuals from opinions that they don't agree with.

A symptom of living in an echochamber is assuming that anybody who
disagrees with you is not only wrong - but is delusional, stupid, and
beyond hopeless. Of course, how could you be such a moron to believe
such things?

The above tweet is a perfect example.

John says many things in this short tweet:

- _Their_ media has detached them from **this** reality!
- _They_ are **more** than delusional!
- _Their_ beliefs are a **threat to democracy!!!**

It doesn't matter who he is talking about. 

Even though it is obvious that he is referring to the majority of Trump supporters with
his statement, many people on the Right are guilty of doing the exact same thing.

He doesn't **know** what _they_ are thinking.
He is not aware that he may be just as delusional as he believes them to be.
After all, the media that **he** consumes is telling him the truth and nothing but the truth.

**Spoiler Alert: Modern media is in the business of preaching to the choir, and you're just singing along with the tune you know best.**

### Example 3 - Pretentious Briton

Ok, one more example.

Nate White of the London Daily penned **<a href="https://londondaily.com/british-writer-pens-the-best-description-of-trump-i-ve-read?fbclid=IwAR3DWSthaGw-9R_biHYymFkrnywF8wdXIGs7j3oXjteJMAInlm_BBJfCwZw"/>this article</a>** highlighting the odious, negative appeal of Trump in the UK (in his opinion of course).

One quote in particular caught my eye:

>Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn’t just talk in crude, witless insults – **he actually thinks in them**. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.

I hope that Nate was being purposefully disingenuous here.

## Help! Somebody is trying to read my mind! What do I do?

Call it out.

Scott Adams outlines how to do this in his book **Loserthink: How Untrained Brains Are Ruining America**. 

> I have
observed over the past few years that when I point out that
someone is forming an opinion based on what they believe to
be their ability to read minds, they will often drop their
confidence levels right away. If it doesn’t happen immediately
after you cleverly label their behavior as mind reading, try this
next: **ask how many times in their personal relationships their
mates or friends have incorrectly assumed what they were
thinking**. This approach hits people hard. We all know it is
common for the people who know us best to misinterpret our
thoughts and intentions. So what are the odds we can
accurately deduce the inner thoughts and intentions of total
strangers?

In conclusion...

Watch out for anybody that says things like "he/she thinks" or "he/she believes."

It's just bullshit.

Nobody can read minds.
